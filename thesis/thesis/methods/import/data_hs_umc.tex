    \textbf{Data comparison.}
    \small Left: Two subjects from the Headspace data set. Right: Two subjects from the Radboudumc data. The meshes on the right contain more artefacts because the photos were captured by a 2-camera setup as opposed to a 5-camera setup. Additionally, the subjects do not wear latex caps which makes the reconstruction of the hair more difficult. The meshes on the left and the meshes on the right are differently oriented in space.
